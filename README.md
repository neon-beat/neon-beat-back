# Neon Beat back

Neon Beat back is the Rust backend powering Neon Beat, a homemade blind test experience built around playlists, teams, and fast-paced buzzer rounds.

See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed release notes.

## Highlights

- **RESTful API**: Provides a well-defined RESTful API for programmatic access to its functionalities.
- **Real-time communications**: Real-time communications via WebSockets for buzzers and Server-Sent Events for the public and admin UIs.
- **Configurable persistence**: Build with MongoDB or CouchDB support and select the active store per deployment. Keeps playlists, teams, and game progress in sync. Playlists are stored in their own collection so games can reuse curated track lists without re-importing them each time.
- **Swagger UI**: The full OpenAPI document is generated with utoipa and served through Swagger UI (`/docs`) for quick manual testing.

## Architecture Overview

### Module layout
The Neon Beat back project follows a layered architecture, separating concerns into distinct modules:
- **`routes`**: This layer handles incoming HTTP requests and defines the API endpoints. It is responsible for parsing requests, calling the appropriate service methods, and returning HTTP responses.
- **`services`**: This layer contains the business logic of the application. It orchestrates operations, interacts with the `dao` layer to retrieve or store data, and applies any necessary transformations or validations.
- **`dao` (Data Access Object)**: This layer is responsible for interacting with external data sources or systems, such as a MongoDB database. It abstracts the details of data persistence and retrieval from the service layer.
  - **`models`**: This submodule within the `dao` layer defines the data models that represent the entities and structures used when interacting with external systems. These models ensure consistent data representation across the application's interactions with various data sources.
- **`dto` (Data Transfer Object)**: This layer defines the data structures used for transferring data between different layers of the application, particularly between the `routes` and `services` layers, and for external API communication. These structures ensure consistent data formats.
- **`state`**: Centralises runtime state kept in memory while the server runs. It exposes the finite-state machine that coordinates gameplay, the in-memory `GameSession`/playlist data used by services and DTOs, the SSE hubs, and shared resources such as buzzer connections.

## Core gameplay features

- **Playlist import & persistence**: JSON playlists where each song has some basic properties and are persisted atomically:
   - Timestamp at which the song should start
   - Time to identify a song
   - Song URL
   - "Point fields" are fields to find for the song, that can give points to a team: for example, song name and artist (this list of field is dynamic and not empty)
   - "Bonus point fields" are optional fields to find for the song, that can give bonus points to a team (this list of field is dynamic and may be empty)
   - During game bootstrap the playlist song order is shuffled once to create a random play sequence; persisted games must provide the same identifiers to guarantee consistency.
- **Game bootstrap**: Game can be created or loaded (from database) during the idle state:
   - the game contains a list of players (players have a unique buzzer, a name and a score)
   - the game references a persisted playlist entity (shared across games) which is embedded into the runtime session when the game starts [**WARNING**: the game considers currently that the playlist doesn't change !]
   - the game contains a game state (frequently saved in database), which contains a playlist state (the playlist state remembers whether a song has been played or not) and must match the playlist identifiers exactly
- **State machine execution**: Gameplay transitions follow the diagram above (`Game state flow`), persisting progress and orchestrating pauses, reveals, and scoring.
- **Admin controls (REST)**:
   - create/load games return a `GameSummary` payload bundling players, shuffled playlist ordering, and timestamps
   - pause the current song
   - resume the current song
   - add/remove points to a team
   - update team metadata (buzzer id, name, score)
   - reveal the current song
   - mark a field as "found"
   - validate/invalidate an answer
- **Prep-phase team pairing**:
   - allow creating/updating/deleting teams while the state machine is `GameRunning::Prep`
   - enforce that buzzers are paired (or explicitly in pairing mode) before transitioning to `Playing`
   - expose admin endpoints to enter/abort pairing mode, snapshot teams, and reassign buzzers with SSE notifications
   - support rollback of pairing operations to restore the last known good snapshot on failure
- **Public API (REST)**:
   - get teams infos
   - get current song infos
   - get current game phase (with degraded flag)
- **WebSocket connection for buzzers**
   - Buzzers connect to `GET /ws` and identify themselves by sending:
     ```json
     { "type": "identification", "id": "<mac_address>" }
     ```
     where `<mac_address>` is a 12-character lowercase hex string.
   - Buzz events reuse the same id:
     ```json
     { "type": "buzz", "id": "<mac_address>" }
     ```
   - Buzzers need to be informed when:
      - Game is paused and it's the team's turn to answer
      - Team's turn is finished and the game resumes
- **SSE connection for frontends**: Admin and public frontends subscribe via `/sse/admin` and `/sse/public`. The admin stream issues a one-time token and enforces a single active admin connection.

## Pairing workflow

The buzzer pairing workflow lives inside the finite state machine so that API calls, SSE notifications, and WebSocket feedback stay in lock-step. A typical session looks like this:

1. **Kick off pairing**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/admin/teams/pairing \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{ "first_team_id": "<uuid-of-team-to-start-with>" }'
   ```
   - The game enters `GameRunning::Prep(Pairing)` and snapshots the roster.
   - Public and admin SSE streams broadcast `pairing.waiting` with the team that must claim a buzzer next.

2. **Assign a buzzer**
   - The highlighted team presses its buzzer (or an operator can simulate it).  
   - The WebSocket client sends `{ "type": "buzz", "id": "<12-char buzzer id>" }`.
   - The backend:
     - Assigns the buzzer while clearing any conflicting assignment.
     - Replies to the device with a `BuzzFeedback` payload (`{"id":"<buzzer id>","can_answer":true}`) so hardware can give immediate confirmation.
     - Emits `pairing.assigned` containing the team UUID and the new buzzer ID.  
     - Emits another `pairing.waiting` if more unpaired teams remain; otherwise it transitions back to `prep_ready`.

3. **Handle deletions mid-pairing**
   - `DELETE /admin/teams/{team_id}` now emits a lightweight `team.deleted` event on the public SSE stream.  
   - If the removed team was the one currently pairing, the server automatically advances to the next unpaired team (broadcast through `pairing.waiting`) or ends pairing if everyone is assigned.

4. **Abort pairing**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/admin/teams/pairing/abort
   ```
   - Restores the snapshot captured when pairing began.
   - Emits `pairing.restored` with the full roster before returning to `prep_ready`.

Public clients can still poll `/public/pairing-status`, but reacting to the SSE stream keeps both admin and public UIs in sync without reloading the complete roster.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (1.85+ recommended)
- MongoDB instance reachable at `MONGO_URI`

### Build from source
```bash
cargo build
```
Binaries live under `target/debug/neon-beat-back` or `target/release/neon-beat-back`.

### Environment

The server relies on a running MongoDB instance and the following optional environment variables:

| Variable     | Default                     | Description |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `MONGO_URI`  | `mongodb://localhost:27017` | Connection string used to create the MongoDB client. |
| `MONGO_DB`   | `neon_beat`                 | Database name (only used when provided). |
| `COUCH_BASE_URL` | – | Base URL for the CouchDB server (e.g. `http://localhost:5984`). |
| `COUCH_DB`   | – | Database name created/used by the Couch backend. |
| `COUCH_USERNAME` /<br>`COUCH_PASSWORD` | – | Optional basic-auth credentials for CouchDB. |
| `NEON_STORE` | – | Required when both backends are compiled; set to `mongo` or `couch` to choose the store at runtime. If only one backend was compiled, the value is optional but must match when supplied. |
| `PORT`       | `8080`                      | TCP port the HTTP server binds to. `SERVER_PORT` is also honoured for compatibility. |

### Selecting a storage backend

The backend ships with both storage implementations enabled by default. At startup:

- If both features were compiled, set `NEON_STORE=mongo` or `NEON_STORE=couch` to choose the active store.
- If only one feature was compiled (for a slimmer binary), `NEON_STORE` is optional, but any value you supply must still match the compiled backend.

To build the binary with a single backend you can rely on Cargo features:

```bash
# Mongo-only build
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features mongo-store

# Couch-only build
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features couch-store
```

### Run locally
1. Decide which store to use and start the matching database:
   - **MongoDB**: `export NEON_STORE=mongo` (when both backends are compiled) and ensure `MONGO_URI`/`MONGO_DB` point to a running instance.
   - **CouchDB**: `export NEON_STORE=couch` (when both backends are compiled) and set `COUCH_BASE_URL`/`COUCH_DB` plus credentials if required.
   - If the binary was built with only one backend, `NEON_STORE` can be omitted; it defaults to the compiled store.
2. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
3. Try a few entry points:
   - Healthcheck: `curl http://localhost:8080/healthcheck`
   - Public SSE stream: `curl -N http://localhost:8080/sse/public`
   - Admin SSE stream (one active client): `curl -N http://localhost:8080/sse/admin`
   - WebSocket buzzer (after `cargo install websocat`):
     ```bash
     ( printf '{"type":"identification","id":"deadbeef0001"}\n'; cat ) | websocat -t ws://localhost:8080/ws
     ```
   - Swagger UI: open `http://localhost:8080/docs`

### Docker

Build the release image with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t neon-beat-back .
```

To ship an image with a single backend, pass the feature flags through the build argument `CARGO_FEATURES` (the value is appended to each Cargo invocation):

```bash
# Mongo-only image
docker build -t neon-beat-back \
  --build-arg CARGO_FEATURES="--no-default-features --features mongo-store" .

# Couch-only image
docker build -t neon-beat-back \
  --build-arg CARGO_FEATURES="--no-default-features --features couch-store" .
```

For cross-compilation, provide a Rust target triple via the optional build argument:

```bash
docker build -t neon-beat-back --build-arg BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu .
```

When using docker-compose (e.g. after copying `docker-compose.example.yaml` as `docker-compose.yaml`), the same argument can be passed through an environment variable:

```bash
BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu docker compose build
```

## Questions

- Do we want to manage public SSE deconnexion ? No
- Do we want to modify a playlist when it is already imported in the backend ? No, we import again
- Do we want to add a timeout when a player has buzzed (to resume the game) ? Add an int config property (default: Infinite)
- Do we want to prevent the previous buzzer to buzz again ? Add a bool config property (default: re-buzz authorized)
- Do we want to serve the OpenAPI documentation as a Github Page ?
- Do we want Game and Playlist name unicity ?
