# Neon Beat back

Neon Beat back is the Rust backend powering Neon Beat, a homemade blind test experience built around playlists, teams, and fast-paced buzzer rounds.

See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed release notes.

## Highlights

- **RESTful API**: Provides a well-defined RESTful API for programmatic access to its functionalities.
- **Real-time communications**: Real-time communications via WebSockets for buzzers and Server-Sent Events for the public and admin UIs.
- **Configurable persistence**: Build with MongoDB or CouchDB support and select the active store per deployment. Keeps playlists, teams, and game progress in sync. Playlists are stored in their own collection so games can reuse curated track lists without re-importing them each time.
- **Swagger UI**: The full OpenAPI document is generated with utoipa and served through Swagger UI (`/docs`) for quick manual testing.

## Utilities

### `tool-colors-gen`

The repository contains a small helper binary that generates curated color assets (HTML previews and JSON exports) for teams.

- Build/run (feature-gated):  
  `cargo run --bin tool-colors-gen --no-default-features --features tool-colors-gen`
- Output location: `${CARGO_TARGET_DIR:-target}/tool-colors-gen/`

The command writes both HTML grids and JSON files in that directory and prints the exact paths once generation completes.

## Configuration

Team colors and buzzer patterns (and future runtime knobs) are read from a JSON file at startup:

- Default location: `config/app.json`
- Override: set the `NEON_BEAT_BACK_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to point at any JSON file

If the file is absent or malformed the backend continues with the built-in defaults so you can run the server without creating a config file. To customise values, drop a file with the following shape:

```json
{
   "colors": [
      { "hue": -64.69388, "saturation": 1.0, "value": 1.0 },
      { "hue": 119.331474, "saturation": 1.0, "value": 1.0 }
   ],
   "patterns": {
      "waiting_for_pairing": {
         "type": "blink",
         "duration_ms": 1000,
         "period_ms": 200,
         "dc": 0.5
      }
   }
}
```

When teams are created without an explicit color, the first unused color from the colors set is assigned automatically (falling back to white if every entry is already taken). Buzzer patterns follow the same principle: any preset omitted from the config falls back to the built-in defaults shown above. To force a fixed color, add an optional `"static_color": { "hue": ..., "saturation": ..., "value": ... }` property next to the timing fields.

### Pattern presets and types

You can override the following pattern templates in the `patterns` section:

- `waiting_for_pairing`
- `standby`
- `playing`
- `answering`
- `waiting`

Each entry accepts:

- `type`: one of `"blink"`, `"wave"`, or `"off"`.
- `duration_ms`: duration before the effect stops (`0` = infinite).
- `period_ms`: full cycle length in milliseconds (for blink/wave).
- `dc`: duty cycle between `0.0` and `1.0`.
- `static_color` (optional): HSV object overriding the team colour for this pattern.

## Architecture Overview

### Module layout
The Neon Beat back project follows a layered architecture, separating concerns into distinct modules:
- **`routes`**: This layer handles incoming HTTP requests and defines the API endpoints. It is responsible for parsing requests, calling the appropriate service methods, and returning HTTP responses.
- **`services`**: This layer contains the business logic of the application. It orchestrates operations, interacts with the `dao` layer to retrieve or store data, and applies any necessary transformations or validations.
- **`dao` (Data Access Object)**: This layer is responsible for interacting with external data sources or systems, such as a MongoDB database. It abstracts the details of data persistence and retrieval from the service layer.
  - **`models`**: This submodule within the `dao` layer defines the data models that represent the entities and structures used when interacting with external systems. These models ensure consistent data representation across the application's interactions with various data sources.
- **`dto` (Data Transfer Object)**: This layer defines the data structures used for transferring data between different layers of the application, particularly between the `routes` and `services` layers, and for external API communication. These structures ensure consistent data formats.
- **`state`**: Centralises runtime state kept in memory while the server runs. It exposes the finite-state machine that coordinates gameplay, the in-memory `GameSession`/playlist data used by services and DTOs, the SSE hubs, and shared resources such as buzzer connections.

## Core gameplay features

- **Playlist import & persistence**: JSON playlists where each song has some basic properties and are persisted atomically:
   - Timestamp at which the song should start
   - Time to identify a song
   - Song URL
   - "Point fields" are fields to find for the song, that can give points to a team: for example, song name and artist (this list of field is dynamic and not empty)
   - "Bonus point fields" are optional fields to find for the song, that can give bonus points to a team (this list of field is dynamic and may be empty)
   - During game bootstrap the playlist song order is shuffled once to create a random play sequence; persisted games must provide the same identifiers to guarantee consistency.
- **Game bootstrap**: Game can be created or loaded (from database) during the idle state:
   - the game contains a list of teams (teams have a unique buzzer, a name and a score)
   - the game references a persisted playlist entity (shared across games) which is embedded into the runtime session when the game starts [**WARNING**: the game considers currently that the playlist doesn't change !]
   - the game contains a game state (frequently saved in database), which contains a playlist state (the playlist state remembers whether a song has been played or not) and must match the playlist identifiers exactly
   - new Game+ behaviour: if a playlist was completed in a prior game session, starting a this game session will treat it as a fresh run.
- **State machine execution**: Gameplay transitions follow the diagram above (`Game state flow`), persisting progress and orchestrating pauses, reveals, and scoring.
- **Admin controls (REST)**:
   - create/load games return a `GameSummary` payload bundling teams, shuffled playlist ordering, and timestamps
   - pause the current song
   - resume the current song
   - add/remove points to a team
   - optionally shuffle the playlist when starting a game via `POST /admin/game/start?shuffle=true` (only if the playlist has not started or was completed)
   - update team metadata (buzzer id, name, score)
   - reveal the current song
   - mark a field as "found"
   - validate/invalidate an answer
   - delete stored games when they are not the active running session
- **Prep-phase team pairing**:
   - allow creating/updating/deleting teams while the state machine is `GameRunning::Prep`
   - enforce that buzzers are paired (or explicitly in pairing mode) before transitioning to `Playing`
   - expose admin endpoints to enter/abort pairing mode, snapshot teams, and reassign buzzers with SSE notifications
   - support rollback of pairing operations to restore the last known good snapshot on failure
- **Public API (REST)**:
   - get teams infos
   - get current song infos
   - get current game phase (with degraded flag)
- **WebSocket connection for buzzers**
   - Buzzers connect to `GET /ws` and identify themselves by sending:
     ```json
     { "type": "identification", "id": "<mac_address>" }
     ```
     where `<mac_address>` is a 12-character lowercase hex string.
   - Buzz events reuse the same id:
     ```json
     { "type": "buzz", "id": "<mac_address>" }
     ```
   - Buzzers need to be informed when:
      - Game is paused and it's the team's turn to answer
      - Team's turn is finished and the game resumes
- **SSE connection for frontends**: Admin and public frontends subscribe via `/sse/admin` and `/sse/public`. The admin stream issues a one-time token and enforces a single active admin connection.

## Pairing workflow

The buzzer pairing workflow lives inside the finite state machine so that API calls, SSE notifications, and WebSocket feedback stay in lock-step. A typical session looks like this:

1. **Kick off pairing**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/admin/teams/pairing \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{ "first_team_id": "<uuid-of-team-to-start-with>" }'
   ```
   - The game enters `GameRunning::Prep(Pairing)` and snapshots the roster.
   - Public and admin SSE streams broadcast `pairing.waiting` with the team that must claim a buzzer next.

2. **Assign a buzzer**
   - The highlighted team presses its buzzer (or an operator can simulate it).  
   - The WebSocket client sends `{ "type": "buzz", "id": "<12-char buzzer id>" }`.
   - The backend:
     - Assigns the buzzer while clearing any conflicting assignment.
     - Replies to the device with a `BuzzerOutboundMessage` payload so hardware can give immediate confirmation.
     - Emits `pairing.assigned` containing the team UUID and the new buzzer ID.  
     - Emits another `pairing.waiting` if more unpaired teams remain; otherwise it transitions back to `prep_ready`.

3. **Handle deletions mid-pairing**
   - `DELETE /admin/teams/{team_id}` now emits a lightweight `team.deleted` event on the public SSE stream.  
   - If the removed team was the one currently pairing, the server automatically advances to the next unpaired team (broadcast through `pairing.waiting`) or ends pairing if everyone is assigned.

4. **Abort pairing**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/admin/teams/pairing/abort
   ```
   - Restores the snapshot captured when pairing began.
   - Emits `pairing.restored` with the full roster before returning to `prep_ready`.
   - Returns the restored roster as an array of `TeamSummary` objects so UIs can resynchronise without waiting for SSE.

Public clients can still poll `/public/pairing-status`, but reacting to the SSE stream keeps both admin and public UIs in sync without reloading the complete roster.

## Realtime interfaces

### WebSocket `/ws` (buzzers)

Buzzers maintain a single long-lived WebSocket connection. Each device **must** identify itself before sending buzz events.

| Direction | Message type | Payload example | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| client → server | `{"type":"identification","id":"deadbeef0001"}` | 12 lowercase hex characters | Required immediately after connecting. |
| client → server | `{"type":"buzz","id":"deadbeef0001"}` | must reuse the identification id | Ignored unless the game is in `prep_ready`, `prep_pairing`, or `playing`. |
| server → client | `{"pattern":{"type":"blink","details":{"duration_ms":1000,"period_ms":200,"dc":0.5,"color":{"h":125.0,"s":1.0,"v":1.0}}}}` (`BuzzerOutboundMessage`) | – | Sent when identification succeeds and whenever the buzzer has to change its pattern (type can be `blink`, `wave` or `off`). |
| server → client | WebSocket close frame | – | Connection closed by the backend (e.g. admin kicked, duplicate connection); client should retry with exponential backoff. |

Messages tagged with any other `type` are ignored.

More details on the JSON messages exchanged with buzzer devices
------------------------------------------------------------

The WebSocket endpoint is intentionally simple: buzzer devices send two kinds of messages (identification and buzz) and the server sends pattern updates that instruct the buzzer firmware how to display LED effects. All messages are JSON text frames.

1) Inbound messages (device → server)

- Identification (must be the first message after opening the socket)

   JSON schema:

   {
      "type": "identification",
      "id": "<12-lower-hex>"
   }

   Example:

   {
      "type": "identification",
      "id": "deadbeef0001"
   }

   Notes:
   - The `id` must be a 12-character lowercase hexadecimal string (no separators). The server enforces this and will close the connection if the id is invalid or missing.
   - The server waits up to 10 seconds for this first message and will drop the connection on timeout.

- Buzz

   JSON schema:

   {
      "type": "buzz",
      "id": "<same-id-as-identification>"
   }

   Example:

   {
      "type": "buzz",
      "id": "deadbeef0001"
   }

   Notes:
   - The `id` must match the id previously provided in the identification message. Buzzes with a mismatched id are ignored.
   - Buzz events are processed only when the game is in a phase where buzzes are meaningful (prep-ready, pairing, or playing). Other phases result in the buzz being ignored.

2) Outbound messages (server → device)

The server uses a single outbound message type, `BuzzerOutboundMessage`, which instructs the buzzer firmware to update its visual pattern. The JSON is a single object with a `pattern` field; that field is a tagged enum describing one of three pattern kinds: `blink`, `wave`, or `off`.

JSON shape (high level):

{
   "pattern": {
      "type": "blink" | "wave" | "off",
      "details": { /* present for blink/wave */ }
   }
}

Detailed fields
- `pattern.type` — string: one of `"blink"`, `"wave"`, or `"off"`.
- `pattern.details` — object (only present for `blink` and `wave`):
   - `duration_ms`: integer, effect duration in milliseconds (`0` = infinite)
   - `period_ms`: integer, period of one cycle in milliseconds
   - `dc`: float, duty-cycle between `0.0` and `1.0`
   - `color`: HSV object `{ "h": float, "s": float, "v": float }` where `h` is hue, `s` is saturation and `v` is value/brightness.

Examples

- Blink pattern example (waiting for pairing):

   {
      "pattern": {
         "type": "blink",
         "details": {
            "duration_ms": 1000,
            "period_ms": 200,
            "dc": 0.5,
            "color": { "h": 125.0, "s": 1.0, "v": 1.0 }
         }
      }
   }

- Wave pattern example (team standby):

   {
      "pattern": {
         "type": "wave",
         "details": {
            "duration_ms": 0,
            "period_ms": 5000,
            "dc": 0.2,
            "color": { "h": 30.0, "s": 1.0, "v": 1.0 }
         }
      }
   }

- Off pattern example:

   {
      "pattern": { "type": "off" }
   }

When these messages are sent
- Immediately after a successful identification the server responds with a `BuzzerOutboundMessage` representing the current pattern the device should show. This gives immediate feedback to the user that the device is connected and recognised.
- During pairing the server sends a `Standby`/`WaitingForPairing` pattern to newly assigned buzzers and may switch other buzzers to `Off` or `Waiting` presets as required.
- During normal gameplay the server pushes `Playing`, `Answering`, and `Waiting` presets to devices so the firmware can reflect whether a team is active, answering, or idle.

Device behaviour expectations
- On receiving a `pattern` object the device should apply the visual effect immediately and keep it for `duration_ms` (or until a new pattern arrives). If `duration_ms` is `0` the effect is indefinite until overridden.
- The device should treat any invalid JSON frame as ignorable and close the socket if the server sends a close frame.
- On unexpected disconnection, buzzer firmware should attempt to reconnect with exponential backoff.

Pattern presets and the HSV colour object are derived from the application config; see `config/app.json` and `src/dto/ws.rs` for the exact `BuzzerPattern` shapes.

Quick sequence example
1. Device opens WebSocket to `/ws`.
2. Device sends: `{ "type": "identification", "id": "deadbeef0001" }`.
3. Server replies with current pattern: `{ "pattern": { "type": "blink", "details": { ... } } }`.
4. When user presses buzzer, device sends: `{ "type": "buzz", "id": "deadbeef0001" }`.
5. Server processes buzz and may reply with a new pattern (e.g. `answering`) and triggers SSE events so UIs update.


### Server-Sent Events

Two SSE streams are available:

- `GET /sse/public` – no authentication, receives public updates.
- `GET /sse/admin` – requires a single active client; the first event contains an admin token that must be echoed by the frontend on subsequent REST calls.

Every connection begins with a `handshake` event:

```json
event: handshake
data: {"stream":"public","message":"public stream connected","degraded":false}
```

Admin streams include an extra `token` field in the same payload. When the storage backend drops out of availability the server emits `system_status` events:

```json
event: system_status
data: {"degraded":true}
```

The remaining events represent gameplay changes. Payload types are defined in `src/dto/sse.rs`.

| Event name | Payload | Stream(s) | Description |
|------------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `fields_found` | `FieldsFoundEvent` | public | Updated list of discovered point/bonus fields for the current song. |
| `answer_validation` | `AnswerValidationEvent` | public | Indicates the validation result: `"correct"`, `"incomplete"`, or `"wrong"`. |
| `score_adjustment` | `TeamSummary` | public | Broadcast after manual score changes. |
| `phase_changed` | `PhaseChangedEvent` | public + admin | FSM transition (optionally includes song snapshot, scoreboard, and paused buzzer id). |
| `team.created` | `TeamCreatedEvent` | public + admin | Newly created team (payload wraps a `TeamSummary`). |
| `team.updated` | `TeamUpdatedEvent` | public | Existing team metadata changed (name, buzzer, or score). |
| `team.deleted` | `TeamDeletedEvent` | public | Team removed; payload only contains the team UUID. |
| `game.session` | `GameSummary` | public | Full game snapshot (teams, playlist ordering, timestamps). |
| `pairing.waiting` | `PairingWaitingEvent` | public + admin | Announces which team should pair a buzzer next. |
| `pairing.assigned` | `PairingAssignedEvent` | public + admin | Confirms a buzzer assignment during pairing. |
| `pairing.restored` | `PairingRestoredEvent` | public | Snapshot broadcast after aborting pairing. |
| `test.buzz` | `TestBuzzEvent` | public + admin | Emitted when a prep-mode test buzz is detected. |

Keep-alive comments are sent every 15 seconds so most SSE clients will stay connected by default.

#### Admin API authentication

All `/admin/**` routes now require the token issued by the admin SSE stream. After a client connects to `/sse/admin`, the initial `handshake` event includes a `token` field. Subsequent admin REST requests must supply this value in the `X-Admin-Token` header (case insensitive). Requests without a token, or with a stale token after the SSE stream disconnects, receive `401 Unauthorized`.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (1.85+ recommended)
- MongoDB instance reachable at `MONGO_URI`

### Build from source
```bash
cargo build
```
Binaries live under `target/debug/neon-beat-back` or `target/release/neon-beat-back`.

### Environment

The server relies on a running MongoDB instance and the following optional environment variables:

| Variable     | Default                     | Description |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `MONGO_URI`  | `mongodb://localhost:27017` | Connection string used to create the MongoDB client. |
| `MONGO_DB`   | `neon_beat`                 | Database name (only used when provided). |
| `COUCH_BASE_URL` | – | Base URL for the CouchDB server (e.g. `http://localhost:5984`). |
| `COUCH_DB`   | – | Database name created/used by the Couch backend. |
| `COUCH_USERNAME` /<br>`COUCH_PASSWORD` | – | Optional basic-auth credentials for CouchDB. |
| `NEON_STORE` | – | Required when both backends are compiled; set to `mongo` or `couch` to choose the store at runtime. If only one backend was compiled, the value is optional but must match when supplied. |
| `PORT`       | `8080`                      | TCP port the HTTP server binds to. `SERVER_PORT` is also honoured for compatibility. |

### Selecting a storage backend

The backend ships with both storage implementations enabled by default. At startup:

- If both features were compiled, set `NEON_STORE=mongo` or `NEON_STORE=couch` to choose the active store.
- If only one feature was compiled (for a slimmer binary), `NEON_STORE` is optional, but any value you supply must still match the compiled backend.

To build the binary with a single backend you can rely on Cargo features:

```bash
# Mongo-only build
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features mongo-store

# Couch-only build
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features couch-store
```

### Run locally
1. Decide which store to use and start the matching database:
   - **MongoDB**: `export NEON_STORE=mongo` (when both backends are compiled) and ensure `MONGO_URI`/`MONGO_DB` point to a running instance.
   - **CouchDB**: `export NEON_STORE=couch` (when both backends are compiled) and set `COUCH_BASE_URL`/`COUCH_DB` plus credentials if required.
   - If the binary was built with only one backend, `NEON_STORE` can be omitted; it defaults to the compiled store.
2. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
3. Try a few entry points:
   - Healthcheck: `curl http://localhost:8080/healthcheck`
   - Public SSE stream: `curl -N http://localhost:8080/sse/public`
   - Admin SSE stream (one active client): `curl -N http://localhost:8080/sse/admin`
   - WebSocket buzzer (after `cargo install websocat`):
     ```bash
     ( printf '{"type":"identification","id":"deadbeef0001"}\n'; cat ) | websocat -t ws://localhost:8080/ws
     ```
   - Swagger UI: open `http://localhost:8080/docs`

### Docker

Build the release image with Docker:

```bash
docker build -t neon-beat-back .
```

To ship an image with a single backend, pass the feature flags through the build argument `CARGO_FEATURES` (the value is appended to each Cargo invocation):

```bash
# Mongo-only image
docker build -t neon-beat-back \
  --build-arg CARGO_FEATURES="--no-default-features --features mongo-store" .

# Couch-only image
docker build -t neon-beat-back \
  --build-arg CARGO_FEATURES="--no-default-features --features couch-store" .
```

For cross-compilation, provide a Rust target triple via the optional build argument:

```bash
docker build -t neon-beat-back --build-arg BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu .
```

When using docker-compose (e.g. after copying `docker-compose.example.yaml` as `docker-compose.yaml`), the same argument can be passed through an environment variable:

```bash
BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu docker compose build
```

- [x] Keep playlist song order (from given JSON) if no shuffle
- [x] Log a warning if a connected buzzer is not paired while launching the game
- [x] Implement a TryFrom instead of `impl From<(GameListItemEntity, PlaylistEntity)> for GameListItem` (compare playlist IDs)

- [ ] Update `game_store` value of `AppState ` and send False to `degraded` watcher each time a GameStore function returns a connection error ?
- [ ] Remove useless features of dependencies if found
- [ ] Implement tests

## Questions

- Do we want to manage public SSE deconnexion ? No
- Do we want to modify a playlist when it is already imported in the backend ? No, we import again
- Do we want to add a timeout when a team has buzzed (to resume the game) ? Add an int config property (default: Infinite)
- Do we want to prevent the previous buzzer to buzz again ? Add a bool config property (default: re-buzz authorized)
- Do we want Game and Playlist name unicity ? No
- Do we want to raise an error if a connected buzzer is not paired while launching the game ? No
